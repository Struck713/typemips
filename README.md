# typemips

MIPS interpreter in TypeScript

### Description

When learning some assembly at my University, we used [MARS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/), a MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator. I thought it would be really cool if I could remake this software in the form of a web app. So I decided first I needed a package that I could update independently of this so-called-web-app. **That is what this is.**

When this package is finished, it should be able to tokenize, parse and interpret MIPS assembly. I also plan on adding functionality for most of the syscalls listed [here](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/help/syscallhelp.html), with the exception of a few of the message dialog ones. Who knows though, I could add them in the future.

### Features to be implemented

- ~~Tokenize MIPS~~
- Parse MIPS
- Interpret MIPS
- Add syscall functionality
- Other things (bug fixes)

### Installation

At some point I will publish this package on  `npm` and then you can just do like `npm install typemips` but I haven't got that far yet, so this is basically a useless repo to you.

### License

I love open source, I always use GPL 3.0. Have at it.
