# typemips

MIPS interpreter in TypeScript

### Description

When learning some assembly at my University, we used [MARS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/), a MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator. 

I thought it would be really cool if I could remake this software in the form of a web app. So I decided first I needed a package that I could update independently of this so-called-web-app. **That is what this is.** 

### Installation

At some point I will publish this package on  `npm` and then you can just do like `npm install typemips` but I haven't got that far yet, so this is basically a useless repo to you.

### License

I love open source, I always use GPL 3.0. Have at it.
